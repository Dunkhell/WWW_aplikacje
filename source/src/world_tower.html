                    After 13 years of planning and site preparation, the tower gained final approval to start construction by the government in November 2010 and the first groundbreaking activities of piling and frame assembly were observed at the construction site in March.

                    On New Year 2016, the LED-pixels of the facade displayed the number "2016".
                    
                    On April 3rd, 2017, Lotte shot off fireworks to celebrate the tower's official opening. On January 1st, 2018, Lotte shot off fireworks with a LED laser show for 7 minutes to celebrate New Year's Day and the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.

                    On March 17th, 2016, before the final phase of external construction, the Diagrid lantern-shaped roof structure was completed. The roof structure was constructed with steel counterparts that are each 12 meters and weigh 20 tons. The counterparts were made up of bent metal panels that are 6 cm thick. The structure itself is 120 meters high, and covers floors 107–123. Approximately 3,000 tons of steel parts, a high-precision 64t tower crane and GPS alignment systems, as well as highly skilled welding technicians were used in the construction of the roof. The roof structure is engineered to withstand its weight without reinforcing pillars, endure earthquakes up to a magnitude of 9 under the Richter magnitude scale and winds up to 80 m/s.
